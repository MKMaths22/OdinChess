Credit to a user called u/tsojtsojtsoj on Reddit for their post which I saw at https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/cmbv5e/for_those_who_want_to_play_chess_in_a_terminal/ . I looked at their design of chess pieces and coded it myself I did not copy any code of theirs, but this saved some time working out where forward slashes, back slashes etc. should go.

Also include the Colorize information.
